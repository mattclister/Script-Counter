She pined in thought,  And with a green and yellow melancholy  She sat like Patience on a monument,  Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?  We men may say more, swear more, but indeed  Our shows are more than will; for still we prove  Much in our vows but little in our love.    But died thy sister of her love, my boy?    I am all the daughters of my father’s house,  And all the brothers, too—and yet I know not.  Sir, shall I to this lady?      Ay, that’s the theme.  To her in haste. Give her this jewel.
